# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.2] — 2026-10-30

### Fixed

- **Unsplash could never serve a Magento demo.** Its search API takes
  `landscape | portrait | squarish` and answers anything else with a 400, while themeseed
  sent the neutral model's `square` — which is what `magento-demo` asks for on every image,
  the catalog grid being 1:1 by Magento convention. The Unsplash adapter now translates;
  Pexels, which does take `square`, is unchanged.
- **One awkward product name took the whole Magento export down.** A stock search that finds
  nothing throws, and `addImage` did not catch it, so the first product no stock library had
  a photo of lost the forty finished products behind it. A miss is now retried on broader
  queries — the query as asked, then without its leading word, then its last two words,
  since Luma-style names put the distinctive part first — and any other failure skips that
  one image rather than ending the run. A rate limit is not retried: broadening after a 403
  would spend an exhausted quota three times over.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-10-29

### Fixed

- The CLI's help and the MCP tool description said "Ghost is supported today. WordPress,
  Joomla, Drupal and Magento are planned". WordPress has been supported since 0.8.0 and
  Magento since 0.9.0, as file exports rather than live seeding, and the README's table says
  so. An assistant read the stale line, concluded `themeseed nic-demo` would not work for a
  WordPress theme, and skipped the step. Both now describe what each platform does: Ghost
  over its Admin API, WordPress and Magento as files that `nic-demo` and `magento-demo`
  write without connecting to a site.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-10-21

### Added

- **Magento demo content (`themeseed magento-demo`, `export_content` with
  `platform: "magento"`).** Writes `catalog.json` (`magento-content/1`) plus `content-media/`
  from a `magento-content-request/1` file, for the magento-theme plugin to fold into a theme
  package. Contract:
  `mcphub/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-21-magento-demo-content-contract.md`.
- The output follows how Luma actually stores a storefront rather than how a blog does: a
  nested category tree, attributes with options and colour swatches emitted before anything
  references them, attribute sets per department, and configurable products whose parent
  carries price while each child carries the axis values, price and weight. Axis attributes
  are always global selects, which is what Magento requires.
- CMS pages and blocks are plain HTML with Magento directives (`{{store url}}`,
  `{{media url}}`, `{{widget}}`), never Page Builder markup; absolute URLs to the store's own
  pages are rejected in favour of `{{store url}}`.
- Sizes and weights are chosen for the store's topic — a sofa is "Three-seat" at 34 kg, a shirt
  is "M" at 0.4 kg — rather than one apparel scale applied to every business.
- Validation before writing: unique keys and SKUs across products and variants, every axis
  global and a select, distinct variant combinations, resolvable attribute/category/option
  references, `special_price` below `price`, no `<script>`, and the media limits.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-10-14

### Added

- **WooCommerce product seeds in `nic-demo`.** Product items support the optional
  `badge`, `rating`, `review_count` and `attributes` fields of the updated
  `nic-content/1` schema. Request seeds for `product` may carry a `product` block and
  `terms` (`product_cat`, `product_tag`); seeds are kept verbatim and their terms are
  created. Extra products follow the seeds' style (attribute names and value shapes,
  price range and format, categories, badges and ratings) with titles in the site's topic.
- Validation before writing: rating within 0–5 and unique attribute names per product, in
  addition to the existing term, sale price and SKU checks.
- Vendored schemas refreshed from the canonical mcphub copies.

### Changed

- Product titles without product seeds are now topic-aware (destination packages for travel
  topics, otherwise named after the topic) instead of generic pass/voucher names.
- README: WordPress is listed as supported (file export); `package.json` description fixed.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-10-13

### Added

- **`themeseed nic-demo` — demo content for NIC Core themes.** Reads a
  `nic-content-request/1` file and writes `<theme>/demo/posts.json`
  (`nic-content/1`) plus `content-media/`, and an image credits file outside the
  theme. The request's seeds (the source design's own posts, team, portfolio,
  testimonials, services and WooCommerce products) keep their key, title and
  every non-empty field byte for byte; ThemeSeed fills the empty fields and
  generates the remaining items, terms, past dates, simple products with valid
  prices and unique SKUs, and body images. Exit `0` written, `1` refused or
  failed with a message naming the fix, `2` usage; `--json` prints one report.
  `posts.json` and `content-media/` are replaced wholesale and nothing else in
  `--out` is touched.
- **Image licensing by target.** For `themeforest` and `wordpress.org` stock
  images (Unsplash, Pexels, Picsum) are refused and `images.source: auto` never
  falls back to them; `local` and `ai` images are credited `GPL-2.0-or-later`
  to the site name. `client` and `private` targets may use stock, credited with
  their real licence and source URL. Images outside the contract's limits
  (jpg/png/webp, 2000px, 500 KB each, 25 MB total) are skipped with a warning.
- The output is validated against the vendored `nic-content-1` schema plus
  cross-reference rules (terms exist, files and references match, credits cover
  every file) before anything is written. Schemas are vendored under
  `src/nic-demo/schema/`; the mcphub copies are canonical.
- `export_content` gains `platform: "nic-demo"` with `request` and `credits`.
- `ajv` is now a runtime dependency (schema validation).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-15

### Added

- **WordPress file export.** `themeseed export --platform wordpress` (and the
  `export_content` MCP tool's new `platform` input) writes `demo-content.xml` —
  a WXR 1.2 file the stock WordPress importer reads — plus an `IMPORT.md` with
  the exact import steps. The neutral content model is unchanged: a new
  `providers/wordpress/gutenberg.ts` serializes the same blocks into
  Gutenberg's comment-delimited grammar, exactly as ghost/lexical.ts's docblock
  predicted a WordPress provider would.

  WordPress's importer works differently from Ghost's, and the export follows
  WordPress's model rather than imitating the Ghost archive: a WXR carries no
  bytes, so images travel as `attachment` items the importer downloads from
  their source URLs ("Download and import file attachments") and re-hosts in
  the media library. That means URL-backed images (the stock source) work and
  local/AI files cannot travel — those are reported in `failed` with the fix,
  never dropped silently. Menus export as `wp_navigation` posts, which appear
  in the Site Editor's navigation picker after import.

### Changed

- **`ExportReport.zipPath` is now `artifactPath`.** The Ghost export writes a
  zip; the WordPress export writes an XML file. One honestly-named field for
  the import artifact beats a `zipPath` that sometimes is not a zip. The
  `export_content` MCP result carries `artifactPath` (and the `platform`) too.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-09-11

### Added

- **Demo content can be written to a file instead of published live.** themeseed
  could only reach a running CMS, which leaves out the case it is most often
  wanted for: a theme author packaging demo content has no site to publish into.
  There is also something a file can do that the API cannot — Ghost's importer
  re-hosts images out of an `images/` directory in the archive, so a site
  imported this way stops depending on whichever stock CDN the pictures came
  from.

  ```
  themeseed export --topic "design journal" --count 15 --out ./demo-content
  ```

  and the matching `export_content` MCP tool. Neither needs a site or a
  credential.

- **Pages, tag descriptions and author bios.** The neutral model was post-only:
  `tags` was a list of names and `authorName` a string, so a theme's tag archive
  and author page had nothing to render. `SeedPage`, `SeedTag` and `SeedAuthor`
  carry the rest. All three are platform-neutral concepts, so a future WordPress
  or Drupal provider inherits them rather than having to invent them.

  A page can say `needsBody: false` when a theme template renders it — an
  "authors" page whose template lists the authors gains nothing from generated
  prose — or carry `suppliedBody` when the caller already has the final markup.

- **Navigation.** Menus import as Ghost settings, which is what stops a freshly
  imported site rendering an empty header and footer.

- `createPages` and `createTags` on the provider contract, both optional so a
  platform is not forced to implement what it has no concept of.

### Fixed

- Exported content carries the `#themeseed` tag, so `wipe` can find it. Without
  it an import could only be undone by hand, which is what rule 3 of the
  provider contract exists to prevent.

### Notes

- **`createAuthors` is intentionally not implemented for Ghost.** Its Admin API
  exposes `/users/` as Browse and Read only: a user is invited by email and must
  accept, which no unattended tool can complete. A method that quietly did
  nothing would be worse than none, because the caller could not tell. The file
  path is unaffected — Ghost's _importer_ does create users.

- **Importing cannot be automated either.** `POST /db/` returns 403 for an
  integration token; Ghost grants `db` access only to `Administrator`,
  `DB Backup Integration` and `Self-Serve Migration Integration`. The manual
  "Import content" step is the only route, not a convenience.

- `core/zip.ts` is a ZIP writer on Node's `zlib` rather than a dependency. This
  package ships six runtime dependencies by design; the encoder is under a
  hundred lines and its test extracts every archive with the system `unzip`,
  including `unzip -t`, so it is checked against a real implementation.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-08

### Added

- **themeseed installs as a Claude Code plugin**, with no npm account and no
  registry configuration:

  ```
  /plugin marketplace add ThemeAnax/themeseed
  /plugin install themeseed@themeseed
  ```

  The plugin is served from the public GitHub repository and carries a prebuilt,
  dependency-inlined copy of the MCP server at `plugin/themeseed-mcp.mjs`. Claude
  Code runs a plugin by cloning the repo and executing what it finds — it does
  not run `npm install` — and the npm package sits on a private registry most
  people cannot read, so shipping the server ready-to-run is what makes the
  plugin installable by anyone at all. It carries no credentials: the Ghost
  Admin API key and any image-provider keys remain the user's own.

- **A `/themeseed` command**, which checks whether a site and image providers are
  configured, walks a first-time user through connecting them, and then seeds.

### Changed

- `readVersion` also looks one directory up from the module that calls it, so the
  bundled plugin — a single file sitting in `plugin/` beside the repository's
  `package.json` — reports its real version instead of `0.0.0-unknown`.
- `prepack` rebuilds the plugin bundle, so a published release cannot carry a
  stale one. A unit test fails if the plugin manifests drift from the package
  version.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **`update_post` (MCP) and `themeseed update` (CLI) edit a post that already
  exists.** Attach a feature image to a post that has none, remove one, splice a
  body image into the prose without rewriting it, or change title, excerpt and
  status. Until now the only repair for one bad post was deleting it and seeding
  again, which is absurd when the failure hit the last three posts of
  twenty-five. Only the fields you name are touched, and the edit carries the
  `updated_at` it read so a concurrent change in Ghost Admin collides rather
  than being silently overwritten.
- **Stock image providers now chain.** With both an Unsplash and a Pexels key
  configured, a provider that fails — a quota, an outage, an empty result — hands
  off to the next instead of ending the run's images. Naming a provider
  explicitly puts it first without disabling the spare. Picsum stays a
  standalone last resort: it cannot search, so chaining it behind a keyed
  provider would quietly swap searched photography for random photography.

### Changed

- **`generate_posts` now reports why images are missing.** A failed image lookup
  only ever reached stderr, which an MCP host does not display, so a run whose
  provider had hit its hourly quota still reported `created: 25, failed: 0` with
  nothing in any of them. The reason now appears in `skipped.images` on both
  surfaces.

### Security

- `update_post` refuses to edit a post that does not carry `#themeseed` unless
  `allowUnseeded` is passed. The tag is re-checked on the record the CMS
  returns, never on the caller's claim, so a mistyped or misremembered id cannot
  overwrite a real article.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **`topic` is now optional on `generate_posts`.** When it is omitted the user is
  asked directly, via MCP elicitation, rather than the calling model inventing a
  subject nobody chose. An empty answer — or a host that does not implement
  elicitation — falls back to a random subject from a deck of ordinary
  publication topics. `themeseed seed` accepts a blank prompt the same way.

### Changed

- **Every post now gets a body image**, not just two in three. Galleries and
  video embeds still rotate across a run, and each is still used only where the
  theme can style it. The old rotation handed every third post a video _instead
  of_ an image, so a three-post run — the smallest useful preview, and the one
  most likely to be judged on — published a post with no image at all.

### Fixed

- **Provider keys added while the MCP server is running are now picked up.**
  `~/.themeseed/.env` was read once at startup, but the server outlives the shell
  that launched it: a key written by `themeseed images` mid-session stayed
  invisible until the editor restarted. `auto` then resolved to `none` and posts
  published with no images while a working Unsplash key sat in the file. The file
  is re-read per seed run, and a key commented out since the last read is
  withdrawn. Variables exported in the user's own shell still win.
- **Theme analysis no longer concludes a theme hides feature images because the
  post it sampled had none.** Ghost emits `og:image` on every post, falling back
  to the publication cover when a post has no feature image of its own; reading
  that as "this post has a hero the theme refuses to render" marked the theme as
  hero-less. The failure was self-reinforcing — one seed run without feature
  images poisoned the next analysis, which then suppressed feature images on
  every later run. Analysis now prefers a sample post that actually has a feature
  image, and otherwise declines to answer rather than guessing.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **The generated MCP config now names the node interpreter explicitly**, as
  `{"command": "<node>", "args": ["<…>/themeseed-mcp"]}` rather than executing
  the binary directly. The installed bin is a symlink to a `.js` file whose
  `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang resolves `node` against PATH, and an editor may
  spawn the server with a PATH carrying no nvm/fnm/volta shim. The spawn then
  died with `env: node: No such file or directory` before the server existed,
  which surfaced only as an MCP entry stuck at "connecting" — with nothing
  listening, reconnecting could never succeed, and the underlying error was
  never shown. The CLI worked throughout, because a shell has node on PATH.
  An already-written config keeps its old shape until the service is
  reinstalled: `themeseed uninstall --tool <id>` then `themeseed install`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-19

### Added

- `themeseed images` configures stock, AI and local image providers at any time,
  with `--list`, `--set`, `--remove` and an interactive wizard.
- `themeseed init` now asks which image providers to set up, and writes
  `~/.themeseed/.env` and `~/.themeseed/sites.example.json`. Both list every
  setting, commented out, so they can be filled in by hand. `--skip-images`
  skips the prompt.
- `imageSource: "none"` publishes posts without images, and `"auto"` picks a
  source from whichever provider keys are configured.
- `studyTheme` on `generate_posts`, and `themeseed seed --study-theme`, read the
  active theme and shape content to it.

### Changed

- **Provider keys now load from `~/.themeseed/.env`** instead of the current
  working directory. The MCP server is launched by an editor in whatever
  directory it has open, so the old lookup found an unrelated `.env` or none at
  all, and stock lookups degraded silently to keyless Lorem Picsum.
- **`imageSource` defaults to `auto`, not `stock`.** With no key configured,
  posts publish without images rather than with unrelated placeholder
  photography. Passing `stock` or `ai` explicitly still fails loudly when the
  key is missing.
- **Theme analysis no longer runs on every seed.** It costs a round trip and
  now happens only when `studyTheme` is set, or when `analyze_theme` /
  `themeseed analyze` is called directly.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- Three more AI image adapters alongside `openai` and `procedural`: `grok`
  (`XAI_API_KEY`, `grok-imagine-image`), `gemini` (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`) and `fal` (`FAL_KEY`).
  Whichever key is present is used; `THEMESEED_AI_IMAGE_ADAPTER` forces one and
  `THEMESEED_AI_IMAGE_MODEL` overrides the model.
- `nearestAspectLabel` snaps a theme's measured aspect ratio onto whatever labels each
  backend accepts, so the generator only ever asks for a number.
- `scripts/probe-ai-adapters.ts` — reports which adapters actually work on this machine.
- `scripts/seed-architecture.ts` — a worked `ContentEngine` example.

### Changed

- Repository is public at `github.com/ThemeAnax/themeseed`; package metadata updated.

### Notes

- Google image models return `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` immediately unless billing is enabled
  on the project — the adapter's hint says so, because it otherwise reads as a transient
  rate limit.
- fal keys are `<id>:<secret>` and are sent as `Authorization: Key …`, not `Bearer`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-14

First release. Ghost support, complete CLI, MCP server.

### Added

**Core**

- `CmsProvider` interface and a provider registry, so a new platform is one directory and one
  registration line.
- Platform-neutral content model: posts as structured blocks (paragraph, heading, image, gallery,
  video, quote, list, code, divider). No CMS storage format appears outside its own provider.
- Multi-site, multi-platform configuration at `~/.themeseed/sites.json`, written `0600`.

**Ghost provider**

- Admin API client with per-request JWT signing from an `<id>:<secret>` Admin API key.
- Theme analysis via two merged strategies — the theme's `.hbs` sources on disk when reachable,
  and the publicly-served theme stylesheet otherwise. Every conclusion carries evidence and the
  result carries a confidence score.
- Block → Lexical conversion covering image, gallery, embed, quote, list, codeblock and divider
  cards, verified by round-tripping through a live Ghost 6 instance.
- Image upload, post creation with backdated publish times, and `#themeseed`-tagged cleanup that
  re-checks the tag client-side before deleting anything.

**Content**

- Deterministic offline generation: five article shapes, compositional paragraphs, article length
  matched to what the theme's layout expects.
- Galleries and video embeds only where the theme was measured to support them.
- Real YouTube videos, each confirmed through the public oEmbed endpoint. Video ids are never
  fabricated.

**Images**

- Three sources behind one interface: `local` (a folder), `stock` (Unsplash, Pexels, or keyless
  Lorem Picsum), `ai` (OpenAI `gpt-image-1`, or a labelled procedural placeholder).
- Dependency-free header parsing for PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP and AVIF, used both for gallery
  dimensions and to reject non-image bytes before upload.

**MCP server** (`themeseed-mcp`)

- Tools: `analyze_theme`, `generate_posts`, `list_seeded`, `wipe_seeded`, `add_site`,
  `list_sites`, `remove_site`.
- `generate_posts` accepts caller-supplied `titles`, so a host model can write the copy while
  themeseed handles structure, images and publishing.
- `wipe_seeded` defaults to a dry run.

**CLI** (`themeseed`)

- `init` detects MCP-capable tools (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Cline,
  Zed), confirms which to configure, and writes each one's native config format — merging rather
  than replacing, and refusing to touch a config file it could not parse.
- `install`, `uninstall`, `mcp-config`, `upgrade`, `add-site`, `remove-site`, `list-sites`, `use`,
  `analyze`, `seed`, `list`, `wipe`, plus `--help` and `--version`.
- Prompts degrade to plain line output when stdout is not a TTY.

### Notes

- Ghost's `GET /ghost/api/admin/themes/` rejects API-token auth on every Ghost version, which is
  why theme analysis reads the rendered stylesheet rather than downloading the theme package.
- Ghost serves `GET /ghost/api/admin/site/` **without** authentication, so `verifyConnection`
  additionally calls an authenticated endpoint. Verifying with `/site/` alone would accept an
  invalid key.
- Ghost's image card silently renders `alt=""` when given `altText`; the property it honours is
  `alt`.
