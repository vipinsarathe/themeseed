# themeseed

Fill a CMS with realistic demo content so you can judge a theme against real-looking
articles — instead of an empty install, a "Coming soon" placeholder, or a wall of lorem ipsum.

themeseed reads the **active theme** first, works out what it can actually display, and then
generates content that fits: hero images at the theme's own aspect ratio, galleries only where
the theme has gallery styles, real embedded videos only where it has embed styles, and articles
long enough to fill the layout the designer built.

It ships as both an **MCP server** (drive it from Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop,
VS Code, Zed…) and a **CLI**.

```bash
themeseed add-site --slug blog --url http://localhost:2368
themeseed analyze blog          # what can this theme display?
themeseed seed blog -t "SaaS productivity blog" -c 15
themeseed wipe blog             # remove exactly what it created
```

## Why

Evaluating a theme against an empty site tells you almost nothing. The hero looks fine because
there is no hero. The archive grid looks tidy because there are three posts. The typography
looks great for 200 words and falls apart at 1,500.

Filling the site by hand is an hour of work you throw away. Filling it with lorem ipsum tells
you about the typography and nothing about the layout, because lorem ipsum has no headings, no
images, no galleries, no pull quotes and no embeds.

themeseed produces content shaped like the real thing — and shaped like _this theme's_ real
thing, because it reads the theme before it writes anything.

## Install

### Claude Code plugin (no npm account needed)

The quickest route, and the only one that needs nothing from IndiaNIC's registry.
In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add ThemeAnax/themeseed
/plugin install themeseed@themeseed
```

That is it — restart Claude Code and the eight themeseed tools are available,
along with a `/themeseed` command that walks you through connecting a site.

The plugin ships a prebuilt, dependency-free copy of the MCP server at
`plugin/themeseed-mcp.mjs`, so there is nothing to install and no registry to
authenticate against. It needs Node 20+ on your PATH, which Claude Code already
requires. You still supply your own Ghost Admin API key and, optionally, your own
image-provider keys — the plugin ships no credentials.

The bundled server gives you the MCP tools. For the `themeseed` CLI (`seed`,
`analyze`, `wipe`, `update`), install the npm package as below.

### npm package (CLI + MCP server)

themeseed is published to IndiaNIC's private registry. Point the `@indianic` scope at it once:

```bash
npm config set @indianic:registry https://npm.indianic.in/
npm login --registry https://npm.indianic.in/ --scope @indianic
```

Then install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @indianic/themeseed
```

Or run it without installing:

```bash
npx @indianic/themeseed init
```

Node 20 or newer is required.

> **Registry note.** The npm package exists only on `npm.indianic.in` and needs an
> account there. The Claude Code plugin above does not — it is served from the
> public GitHub repository. See [Open questions](#open-questions).

## Quick start

```bash
themeseed init
```

`init` does three things:

1. Detects MCP-capable tools installed on your machine.
2. Asks which of them to register the themeseed MCP server with, and writes each one's config
   in its own native format (merging, never replacing).
3. Offers to add your first site.

Adding a site verifies the credentials before saving them, so a bad key fails immediately rather
than half way through a seed run.

```
$ themeseed analyze blog

bohomian v1.0.0
Bohomian — a quiet, Scandinavian Ghost theme.

  feature image   yes (ratio ≈ 1.33)
  gallery card    yes
  video embed     yes
  bookmark card   yes
  wide images     yes
  shows tags      yes
  shows author    yes (with avatar)
  reading time    yes
  target length   ~1400 words (910–2030)
  posts per page  12

  confidence 0.95 via local-theme-files, rendered-site
```

Then fill it:

```
$ themeseed seed blog -t "SaaS productivity blog" -c 15

✔ Created 15 of 15 post(s) on "blog"

  theme            bohomian
  feature images   15
  inline images    5
  galleries        5
  video embeds     5
```

Every post is tagged `#themeseed` (an internal, non-public tag on Ghost), which is how
`themeseed wipe` removes exactly this content and nothing else.

## CLI reference

themeseed uses [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) for argument parsing and
[@clack/prompts](https://github.com/bombshell-dev/clack) for interactive input. Prompts degrade
to plain line output when stdout is not a TTY, so piping and CI logs stay readable.

### Setup

| Command                             | What it does                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `themeseed init`                    | First-run setup: write config files, register the MCP server, pick image providers, add a site |
| `themeseed images [--list]`         | Configure where post images come from, at any time                                             |
| `themeseed install [-t <id>…] [-a]` | Register the MCP server with an editor, without the full init flow                             |
| `themeseed uninstall [-t <id>…]`    | Remove the MCP server from editor configuration                                                |
| `themeseed mcp-config`              | Print the JSON snippet for manual configuration                                                |
| `themeseed upgrade [--check]`       | Check the registry for a newer version and install it                                          |
| `themeseed --version` / `-v`        | Print the installed version                                                                    |
| `themeseed --help` / `-h`           | Show help (also `themeseed help <command>`)                                                    |

### Sites

| Command                        | What it does                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `themeseed add-site`           | Register a CMS. Verifies credentials before saving |
| `themeseed remove-site [slug]` | Forget a site. Deletes no content                  |
| `themeseed list-sites`         | List configured sites (never prints credentials)   |
| `themeseed use <slug>`         | Set the default site used when no slug is given    |

`add-site` accepts `--slug`, `--platform`, `--url`, `--key` and `--themes-dir` for scripting.
Prefer the interactive prompt for the key: a credential passed as a flag lands in your shell
history and in `ps` output.

### Content

| Command                             | What it does                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `themeseed analyze [site] [--json]` | Report what the active theme can display, with evidence |
| `themeseed seed [site]`             | Generate and publish demo content                       |
| `themeseed list [site] [--json]`    | List content themeseed created                          |
| `themeseed wipe [site] [-y]`        | Delete everything themeseed created                     |

`seed` options:

| Flag                          | Default    | Meaning                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

| `-c, --count <n>`             | `12`       | How many posts to create                                    |
| `-i, --image-source <source>` | `auto`     | `auto`, `local`, `stock`, `ai` or `none`                    |
| `--study-theme`               | off        | Read the active theme and shape content to it               |

| `--seed <n>`                  | topic hash | Seed the generator for reproducible output                  |
| `-y, --yes`                   | off        | Skip the confirmation prompt                                |

### NIC Core demo content (`nic-demo`)

```bash
themeseed nic-demo --request <file> --out <theme>/demo --credits <file> [--json]
```

Writes the demo package a NIC Core theme imports (`posts.json` in the `nic-content/1` format plus
`content-media/`) from a `nic-content-request/1` file that lists the post types, counts and the
source design's own items ("seeds"). Seeds keep their key, title and every non-empty field
byte for byte; ThemeSeed fills the empty fields and generates the remaining items, terms,
dates, products and images.

| Flag               | Meaning                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--request <file>` | The content request                                                                     |
| `--out <dir>`      | The theme's `demo/` folder. Only `posts.json` and `content-media/` are replaced         |
| `--credits <file>` | Where image credits are written. Must be outside `--out`, so they never ship in the zip |
| `--json`           | Print one report object on stdout (`{ ok, written, counts, credits, warnings }`)        |

Exit codes: `0` written, `1` refused or failed (the message names the fix), `2` usage or an
invalid request. For targets `themeforest` and `wordpress.org` stock images (Unsplash, Pexels,
Picsum) are refused, because the images ship inside a GPL product: use `ai`, or `local` for a
folder of your own images. `client` and `private` targets may use stock. Every file is checked
against the contract (jpg/png/webp, at most 2000px and 500 KB each, 25 MB in total) and an image
that breaks a limit is skipped with a warning rather than shipped; ThemeSeed does not resize.
**WooCommerce product seeds (0.8.1+).** A `types.product.seeds[]` entry may carry a `product`
block (`type`, `regular_price`, `sale_price`, `sku`, `stock_status`, `featured`, plus `badge`,
`rating` (`"0"`–`"5"`, one decimal), `review_count` and `attributes`: `[{ "name", "values": [] }]`,
where route-style values read `"D1 | Malé"`) and `terms` (`{ "product_cat": ["beach"], "product_tag": [] }`
as slugs). Seeds are kept verbatim; their terms are created (named from the slug, Title Case),
and the product categories/tags are limited to the ones the seeds use. Extra products up to
`count` follow the seeds' style: the same attribute names and value shapes (durations, route
steps, inclusion lists), prices in the seeds' range and format with round values, badges and
ratings drawn from the seeds' own, and titles in the site's topic (for a travel site,
destination packages such as "Kyoto Escape"). Without product seeds, extras are plain
topic-named products with a price and no attributes. Before writing, the package is checked for
rating range, sale below regular price, unique SKUs, unique attribute names and that every
referenced term exists.

The same operation is the `export_content` MCP tool with `platform: "nic-demo"`, `request` and
`credits`. The contract lives in the mcphub repo
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-13-demo-content-contract.md`); the schemas under
`src/nic-demo/schema/` are vendored copies of the canonical ones.

### Magento demo content (`magento-demo`)

```bash
themeseed magento-demo --request <file> --out <theme>/demo --credits <file> [--json]
```

Writes the demo package a Magento theme ships (`catalog.json` in the `magento-content/1` format
plus `content-media/`) from a `magento-content-request/1` file that names the departments, how
many products each leaf category holds, and the products the design itself shows ("seeds"). The
magento-theme plugin runs this as a subprocess and folds the result into the theme zip.

| Flag               | Meaning                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--request <file>` | The content request                                                                     |
| `--out <dir>`      | The theme's `demo/` folder. Only `catalog.json` and `content-media/` are replaced       |
| `--credits <file>` | Where image credits are written. Must be outside `--out`, so they never ship in the zip |
| `--json`           | Print one report object on stdout (`{ ok, written, counts, credits, warnings }`)        |

Exit codes match `nic-demo`: `0` written, `1` refused or failed, `2` usage.

The output is shaped after how Luma — the sample data every Magento theme is designed against —
actually stores a storefront, rather than after a blog:

- **A nested category tree**, up to four levels, the way Luma's `Men > Tops > Jackets` is. A
  department with children becomes a landing page as well as a grid (`PRODUCTS_AND_PAGE`).
- **Attributes, options and swatches** emitted before anything references them, because an
  attribute's `backend_type` is what decides which EAV value table a product's value lands in.
  Colour swatches carry Luma's own hexes, so a theme's swatch strip looks like the one it was
  designed for.
- **Configurable products**: a parent carrying price and no axis values, and children carrying
  the axis values, their own price and weight. An axis attribute is always `global` and a
  `select`, because Magento refuses anything else and the refusal surfaces inside
  `setup:upgrade` rather than as anything readable.
- **CMS pages and blocks as plain HTML with Magento directives** — `{{store url="…"}}`,
  `{{media url="…"}}`, `{{widget …}}` — never Page Builder markup. Across a full Luma database
  there are 110 `{{store url}}` directives and one stray `data-content-type`. Absolute URLs are
  rejected: a stock Luma block has `http://localhost:8090/…` baked into it, which is dead on
  every other host.
- **Sizes and weights chosen for the topic.** A sofa is "Three-seat" and weighs 34 kg; a shirt
  is "M" and weighs 0.4 kg. Luma keeps three separate size vocabularies for the same reason.

ThemeSeed never emits what Magento derives: no `url_rewrite` rows, no index tables, no entity
ids. Everything is addressed by `key`, and the data patch resolves them through Magento's own
repositories. The contract lives in the mcphub repo
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-21-magento-demo-content-contract.md`); the schemas under
`src/providers/magento/schema/` are vendored copies.

The same operation is the `export_content` MCP tool with `platform: "magento"`.

## MCP tools

Run `themeseed install` to register the server, or add it by hand:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "themeseed": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package", "@indianic/themeseed", "themeseed-mcp"],
      "env": { "npm_config_registry": "https://npm.indianic.in/" }
    }
  }
}
```

VS Code nests servers under `servers` rather than `mcpServers`; Zed calls them
`context_servers`. `themeseed install` handles each format for you.

**Tip:** pass your own headlines to `generate_posts` via `titles`. The built-in engine writes
serviceable copy, but a model that knows the client's voice writes better copy — this lets it
supply the words while themeseed handles structure, images, capability-gating and publishing.

## How theme analysis works

This is the part that makes the output fit rather than merely exist. It is **opt-in**, because
it costs a round trip and only pays for itself when you want content shaped to a specific
theme:

```bash
themeseed seed blog --topic "SaaS productivity" --study-theme
themeseed analyze blog          # read the theme without publishing anything
```

Over MCP, set `studyTheme: true` on `generate_posts`. Without it, themeseed generates against
neutral assumptions — a feature image, tags, an author, about 850 words, and no cards a theme
might not style.

Ghost's Admin API **will not serve theme files**: `GET /ghost/api/admin/themes/` returns
`403 NoPermissionError` for API-token auth on every Ghost version, because it requires a staff
session. So themeseed uses two strategies and merges them.

**1. Local theme files** (confidence 0.9) — when Ghost runs on this machine and you point
`--themes-dir` at `content/themes`. Reads the active theme's `.hbs` templates, `package.json`
and compiled CSS. This is as close to ground truth as it gets: `card_assets: true` proves every
Koenig card is styled; `{{#if feature_image}}` proves the hero is rendered; a table-of-contents
partial proves the theme expects long articles.

**2. The rendered site** (confidence 0.6) — always available, including Ghost(Pro) and any
remote install. The trick: a theme's own stylesheet is a public asset. Fetching it and looking
for `kg-gallery-container`, `kg-embed-card`, `kg-width-wide` answers the card questions with
real evidence rather than assumption. The rendered post page supplies the rest — hero, tags,
author avatar, reading time.

The higher-confidence strategy wins any contested field; the lower one fills what nobody else
measured. Anything still unmeasured falls back to conservative defaults **and lowers the reported
confidence**, so a low number means "we guessed", not "the theme is limited".

Which theme is active comes from `GET /ghost/api/admin/settings/` (`active_theme`), which
API tokens _may_ read.

Every conclusion is recorded in `evidence[]`:

```
- [local-theme-files] package.json config.card_assets enables Ghost card styles for all cards
- [local-theme-files] feature image aspect-ratio ≈ 1.33 (most common of the ratios attached to
  feature images; 3 occurrence(s), via class)
- [rendered-site] card selectors in served CSS — gallery:true embed:true bookmark:true wide:true
```

### Why capability-gating matters

A gallery card in a theme with no gallery styles renders as a broken-looking stack of images.
That is _worse_ than the plain post it replaced, because it makes a good theme look buggy.
themeseed only emits a block when the theme was measured to support it.

## Image sources

One interface, four interchangeable implementations, selected with `--image-source`.

**Images are optional.** With no provider key configured, posts publish as text, which is a
fair preview of a theme in its own right. Configure a provider whenever you want one:

```bash
themeseed images                 # interactive
themeseed images --list          # what is configured, and what `auto` picks
themeseed images --set unsplash --key <key>
themeseed images --set local --key /Users/you/Pictures/seed
themeseed images --remove unsplash
```

Keys are stored in `~/.themeseed/.env`. `themeseed init` asks about this too.

### `auto` (the default)

Uses `ai` when an AI key is set, `stock` when a stock key is, and `none` otherwise. A
generated image matches the post's subject exactly; a searched photograph is at least topical;
neither is worth faking with unrelated placeholder art. `auto` never fails — it degrades.
Naming a source explicitly is a decision rather than a preference, so `stock` and `ai` still
fail loudly when their key is missing.

### `none`

Sources no images. Posts publish as text.

### `local`

Scans a directory (`THEMESEED_LOCAL_IMAGE_DIR`) and picks files whose aspect ratio is closest to
what the theme wants. Fully offline and reproducible. Descriptive filenames become alt text;
camera filenames like `IMG_4821` are rejected in favour of the query, because bad alt text is
worse than generic alt text.

### `stock`

| Adapter    | Key                   | Query-relevant?                  |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `unsplash` | `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` | yes                              |
| `pexels`   | `PEXELS_API_KEY`      | yes                              |
| `picsum`   | none                  | **no** — real photos, but random |

Picks whichever key is present, else falls back to Lorem Picsum so the zero-config path still
works. Picsum returns genuine photographs at the right dimensions, which is enough to judge a
theme's _layout_, and useless for judging whether images match the copy — so every image it
returns carries a `credit` saying exactly that. Set `THEMESEED_STOCK_PROVIDER` to force one.

### `ai`

| Adapter      | Key              | Default model            | Actually AI? |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| `openai`     | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-image-1`            | yes          |
| `grok`       | `XAI_API_KEY`    | `grok-imagine-image`     | yes          |
| `gemini`     | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `gemini-2.5-flash-image` | yes          |
| `fal`        | `FAL_KEY`        | `fal-ai/flux/schnell`    | yes          |
| `procedural` | none             | —                        | **no**       |

Whichever key is present is used; `THEMESEED_AI_IMAGE_ADAPTER` forces one and
`THEMESEED_AI_IMAGE_MODEL` overrides the model. Each backend asks for output shape
differently — `aspect_ratio`, `imageConfig.aspectRatio`, named size presets — so themeseed
snaps the theme's measured ratio onto whatever that backend supports and the generator only
ever asks for a number.

Two things worth knowing before picking one:

- **Gemini image models require billing enabled on the project.** Without it every call
  returns `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` immediately, which reads like a rate limit that will clear
  on its own. It will not.
- **fal keys are `<id>:<secret>`**, sent as `Authorization: Key …` rather than `Bearer`.

`procedural` renders deterministic abstract artwork locally — gradients and soft geometry, no
network, no key. It exists so `--image-source ai` still produces valid, correctly-sized images
out of the box and so the integration tests are hermetic. It is not AI, and every image it
produces says so in its credit line.

Check what actually works on your machine, one image per configured adapter:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/probe-ai-adapters.ts --ratio 1.5
```

Adding a backend (Replicate, Stability, a local diffusion server) means implementing
`AiImageAdapter` and adding one line to `selectAiAdapter` — see `src/images/ai-source.ts`.

### Validation

Every image is parsed before upload. Stock APIs and CDNs return HTML error pages with image URLs
often enough that uploading unverified bytes reliably produces posts full of broken images, so
bytes that are not a decodable PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/AVIF are dropped with a warning.

## Content generation

The default engine is deterministic, offline and free. It composes each paragraph from a claim, an
elaboration and usually an example or caveat, drawn from rotating decks so a 1,400-word article
does not visibly repeat. Titles cycle through five article shapes — guide, listicle, opinion,
case study, explainer — so a batch of fifteen looks like a real publication's archive rather than
fifteen variations of one headline.

It is not trying to write good essays. It is trying to produce headings, paragraph rhythm,
article length, pull quotes, lists and images that stress a layout the way real content will.

Two ways to get better prose without touching the code:

- Pass `titles` (MCP) or use your own copy — the host model writes, themeseed structures.
- Implement `ContentEngine` (`src/content/engine.ts`) and pass it to `generateSeedContent`.

**Videos are always real.** themeseed searches YouTube, then confirms each candidate through the
public oEmbed endpoint — which only answers for videos that exist and permit embedding — and takes
the title, author and thumbnail from that response. A fabricated video ID renders as "Video
unavailable", which looks like a broken theme, so ids are never invented.

## Supported platforms

| Platform  | Status                                                                                                                               |

| Drupal    | 📋 Planned — contributions welcome                                                                                                   |

Adding one is a self-contained job: implement `CmsProvider`, register it, add tests. Nothing in
the content generator, image sources, CLI or MCP tools needs to change. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration

Everything lives in `~/.themeseed/`, never inside a repository:

| File                 | What it holds                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sites.json`         | The sites you seed, with credentials. Written by `themeseed add-site` |
| `.env`               | Image and AI provider keys. Written by `themeseed init` and `images`  |
| `sites.example.json` | A documented template for `sites.json`, with every field explained    |

`themeseed init` creates all three. Every setting appears in `.env` already, commented out, so
you can fill it in with an editor instead of a prompt — themeseed never overwrites that file.
Set `THEMESEED_CONFIG_DIR` to move the directory elsewhere.

Both the CLI and the MCP server read `~/.themeseed/.env` by absolute path. They deliberately do
not read a `.env` from the current directory: an editor launches the MCP server in whatever
directory it has open, so a relative lookup finds a different file every time, or none.

`sites.json` is written `0600`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "defaultSite": "blog",
  "sites": {
    "blog": {
      "platform": "ghost",
      "url": "http://localhost:2368",
      "credentials": { "adminApiKey": "<id>:<secret>" },
      "options": { "themesDir": "/path/to/ghost/content/themes" }
    }
  }
}
```

Get a Ghost Admin API key from **Ghost Admin → Settings → Integrations → Add custom
integration**. It is the key with a colon in it — the Content API key will not work.

Every environment variable is listed and documented in the generated `~/.themeseed/.env`.
(The repository's own [`.env.example`](.env.example) configures the e2e suite, not normal use.)
`THEMESEED_LOG_LEVEL=debug` turns on verbose diagnostics; all logging goes to stderr, because
stdout belongs to the MCP protocol.

## Architecture

```
src/
  core/types.ts            platform-neutral domain model — the contract everything shares
  core/seed.ts             analyze → generate → publish, used by both CLI and MCP
  providers/provider.ts    the CmsProvider interface
  providers/registry.ts    platform name → implementation (one line per platform)
  providers/ghost/         the only place Ghost's vocabulary exists
  content/generator.ts     topic + capabilities → neutral blocks
  content/engine.ts        prose, behind a swappable interface
  images/                  local | stock | ai, behind one ImageSource interface
  mcp/                     MCP server and tools
  cli/                     commander + clack
```

Two rules hold the whole thing together:

1. **Nothing outside `src/providers/<platform>/` may import that platform's types.** Shared code
   talks only to `CmsProvider`.
2. **The generator emits neutral blocks, never a CMS storage format.** Conversion to Ghost's
   Lexical happens only in `src/providers/ghost/lexical.ts`. This is what makes WordPress support
   a provider-only change rather than a rewrite.

## Development

### The Claude Code plugin

`plugin/themeseed-mcp.mjs` is a committed build artifact — the only one in the
repository. It has to be, because Claude Code installs a plugin by cloning this
repo and running what it finds: there is no install step, and the npm package is
on a registry most plugin users cannot read.

Rebuild it whenever the server changes, and always before tagging a release:

```bash
npm run build:plugin
```

`prepack` runs it too, so `npm publish` cannot ship a release whose plugin bundle
is stale. `test/unit/plugin-manifest.test.ts` fails if the version in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or `marketplace.json` drifts from `package.json`.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # point GHOST_TEST_BLOG_* at a disposable Ghost
npm run verify            # typecheck + lint + unit tests
npm run test:e2e          # integration tests against the real instance
npm run test:loop         # the autonomous seed/verify/wipe loop
```

`npm run test:loop` seeds 15 posts, verifies them by reading back through Ghost's own Admin API
(deliberately not through themeseed's `listSeeded`, so a bug affecting both cannot hide), and
repeats until three consecutive clean runs, then wipes and confirms zero. Each iteration is
appended to `test-loop.log`.

Handy probes, none of which are part of the test suite:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/probe-theme.ts --themes-dir /path/to/content/themes
npx tsx scripts/probe-images.ts
npx tsx scripts/probe-video.ts "deep work"
npm run build && npx tsx scripts/probe-mcp.ts
```

## Open questions

Three decisions are deliberately **not** settled in code. See
[OPEN-QUESTIONS.md](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) for the full trade-offs.

1. **License** — currently MIT, provisionally. Confirm MIT vs Apache-2.0.
2. **Distribution** — private to `npm.indianic.in`, or also public npm/GitHub under a public org.
3. **Stock image provider** — standardise on Unsplash, Pexels, both, or keep all three.

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Provisional pending the decision above.
